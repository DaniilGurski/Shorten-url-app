## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
My first project using styled components library ! At first it was a bit clunky (since I was limiting myself to using util classes), but with each new component I got better and development felt faster. In this project I used my knowledge of conditional styling using custom props and style extanding. Apart from that, I'm also quite happy with how I was able to utilize the grid for a responsive layout, particularly in the advanced stats section. 


### Continued development
In future projects I should try to refactor some styles like media queries into components, as I usually try to do when I use scss and its mixins.
